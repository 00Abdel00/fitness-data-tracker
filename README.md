# 🏋️‍♂️ Fitness Data Tracker: From Cut to Bench Press PR

This project documents a personal challenge: cutting from 90.6 kg to an estimated 12% body fat while maintaining strength — specifically, preserving and later increasing bench press performance. It's both a personal transformation and a professional data storytelling piece using tools like Excel, Python, and Tableau.

## 🎯 Goals

### Phase 1 — Fat Loss (May 1 – Oct 1, 2025)
- 📉 Reduce body weight from **90.6 kg → ~75.7 kg**
- 💪 Maintain bench press strength (~1RM baseline from May 1)
- ⏱ Duration: 20 weeks

### Phase 2 — Strength Gain (Starting October 2025)
- 🏋️ Increase 1RM bench press to **100 kg**
- ⚖️ Maintain lean body mass and weight
